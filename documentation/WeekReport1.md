## Report for week 1

The first week was mostly about familiarisation. I read the course pages, familiarised myself with the given examples of topics for the project and eventually chose comparing data structures as my project. I then read about the various heap data structures and chose four of them for implementation (although should my selections prove to be clearly suboptimal or otherwise problematic, I am still more than open to changing them).

After the selection, I began the concrete work: first, I reminded myself how Gradle works and then created a basic project structure and pushed it to the Github repository I created. Finally, I began writing the documentation. I also created a preliminary schedule for the project. It is, of course, subject to change once the project gets underway.

Week 1: see above

Week 2: implement binary heap, write tests, create basic UI functionality

Week 3: research binomial heap, begin implementation and testing

Week 4: finish binomial heap, research pairing heap and begin implementation

Week 5: finish implementing and testing pairing heap, research fibonacci heap, begin documentation

Week 6: begin implementing and testing fibonacci heap, continue documentation

Week 7: finish fibonacci heap, finish documentation, return project

__Time spent this week:__

6 hours

__What next:__

Start the actual project by implementing a binary heap to act as a baseline. I will also create a rudimentary UI for the whole project and write tests (which means also reacquainting myself with JUnit).
