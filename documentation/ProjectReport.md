## General structure of the program

The program consists of four implementations of the heap data structure: binary heap, binomial heap, pairing heap and fibonacci heap. In addition, the program has a rudimentary console-based command line interface for running performance tests on the heap operations of the aforementioned heaps.

All the heap implementations are maximum heaps and they have the standard heap operations:

* heap-insert(H, k): add key _k_ into heap _H_
* heap-max(H): return the maximum key value in heap _H_
* heap-del-max(H): delete and return the maximum key value in heap _H_.

The heaps also have a selection of helper methods as required by the above heap operations.

## Time and space complexities
